# Nginx Node Proxy

A simple Nginx proxy configured to provide access to a node's RPC and Remote Signer ports to authorised IP addresses only. 

This is useful to run nodes on Akash until native access controls are implemented.

Check the example [deploy.yml](./deploy.yml) or [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) for examples of how to use.
